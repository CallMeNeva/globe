# "Shortcut" properties. Since properties can be specified as CLI arguments, these are declared essentially as aliases with more
# conventional (in terms of CLI) names for actual Spring properties, i.e. instead of passing in '--spring.datasource.username=admin' you can
# can simply pass in '--user=admin'. Alternatively, you can simply save the values in this file.
